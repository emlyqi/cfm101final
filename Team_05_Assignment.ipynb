    "The goal of the market \"meet\" portfolio is to match the returns of the average of the TSX60 and S&P500 indices as closely as possibly. To do this, we look at various indicators that can provide insight into a stock's ability to match market returns. Below are the factors we plan to take into account while constructing our portfolio:  \n",

    "Beta is a measure of volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the market. A beta of 1.0 indicates that a stock follows the market's returns exactly. In this case, yfinance provides a beta value comparing each stock the S&P500 index. However, as we want to match the average of both the TSX60 and the S&P500, we will calculate beta when compared to the TSX60. Then, we can take the average of the two betas in order to accurately represent the volatility compared to the index used in this assignment.  \n",
